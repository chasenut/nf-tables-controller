# nf-tables controller

Written in C++ and Qt (6.5.3) QML using Linux's NFTables as a network filer.
NFT Manager is a basic tool, project made for learning and as a mini challange. Nothing crazy, basic functions, don't be scared when you get disconnected from any other services while using it, it blocks incoming packets.


# Build and run

I use CMake, for build and run I prefer to use QtCreator, if you want to make it from CLI, apply same rules as in my previous project [FilesExplorer](https://github.com/Cashtann/FileExplorer/tree/master).

# Features

### TCP and UDP counter.

Counts all incoming TCP and UDP packets (in period of 10 seconds).

Block all incoming packets, still applies after reboot (be carefull, may disconnect you from other services).

### Reset NFTables.

If anything goes wrong, you can reset NFTables to default configuration.

### Block cutom IP Address.

Block all incoming packets from specified custom IP Address (you need to provide a valid one, it is not supporting IP Address validation).
